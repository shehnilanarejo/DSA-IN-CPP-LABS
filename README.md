Welcome to the repository for my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) labs in C++ from my university semester. This repository contains all the lab exercises and projects I've worked on during the course. Each lab is designed to strengthen my understanding of various data structures and algorithms and their implementation in C++.

Introduction This repository contains a collection of lab exercises for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, part of my Software Engineering curriculum. The labs cover a range of topics including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and more.

Labs Topics Lab 1: Basic Concepts of DSA

Introduction to fundamental concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms. Lab 2: Array Data Structures

Implementation and manipulation of array data structures. Lab 3: Searching Algorithms

Exploration of different searching algorithms. Lab 4: Sorting Operations in an Array

Implementation and analysis of sorting algorithms on arrays. Lab 5: Stack Data Structure

Understanding and application of the stack data structure. Lab 6: Expression Evaluation through Stack Data Structure

Practical use of stacks for evaluating mathematical expressions. Lab 7: Queue Data Structure

Implementation and utilization of the queue data structure. Lab 8: Recursive Algorithms (Recursion)

Introduction and implementation of recursive algorithms. Lab 9: Tree Data Structure

Understanding tree structures and their applications. Lab 10: Tree Traversal Algorithms

Implementation and analysis of various tree traversal algorithms. Lab 11: Graph Data Structure

Introduction to the graph data structure and its basic operations. Lab 12: Graph Traversal Algorithms

Exploration of algorithms for traversing graphs.

I hope this repository can also be a useful resource for fellow students and anyone interested in learning about data structures and algorithms. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are always welcome.

Thank you for visiting!
